  		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>
			STEAM is a student-led effort to ignite communications between disparate fields in academia, business, and thought. Our focus is broad but our starting point is uniting the Arts with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). We started at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and have grown on campuses throughout the United States.
