	          	<h4>An Editorial by Felicita Devlin</h4>

	          	<p>Growing up, I restrained myself from envisioning a STEM-based career. I tried to foster my passion for Marine Biology and Astronomy, but I felt isolated by what I saw in the classroom and in the industry. I studied hard, but my efforts were devalued. I was told to stay within a creative field, where I wouldn’t have to work twice as hard to succeed. I realized that careers within science, technology, engineering, and math are isolating spaces that don’t recognize my heritage and perceive it as primitive and underdeveloped.  This was my primary reason why I chose to go to an art and design college instead.</p>

				<p>For a long time I tried to avoid the labels of “angry social justice warrior” and being a “special snowflake.” These assumptions exclude social and political from the academic conversation. It normalizes that scientific research to be strictly objective and within a western hegemonic lens.</p>

				<p>Over the last two years, I have served as a project chair and co-president for RISD Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics, known as STEAM. STEAM, an organization a part of a national movement to include Art & Design in STEM Education. Through our programs and events, we aim to inspire a generation of creative problem solvers. We strongly believe multidisciplinary working & learning will empower teams in an increasingly connected world. However, within my own STEAM chapter and beyond, it hasn’t been an easy feat as a queer Latinx student.</p>

				<p>Unlearning traditional academic thought does not just apply to STEM.  It is necessary in order to construct our own interdisciplinary curriculum to express broader experiences and create intersectional futures. STEAM is a movement that reconstructs a traditional space that STEM took up. It has become a platform for radical discourse to act on restorative justice.We do not put enough efforts to unlearning our traditional Western narratives within the STEAM movement as well. In order for STEAM to move forward as a movement, we must put more effort into unlearning traditional Western narratives and subverting white supremacy within educational spaces.</p>

				<p>STEAM utilizes art and design in the process of multidisciplinary critical thinking to generate new solutions. The practice of critical thinking requires us to interrogate previously narrow-minded thinking. Decolonial thinking, is integral to the critical thinking process that disrupts traditional practices to enact change. This movement encourages constant collaboration within our community and beyond, so we are able to disrupt traditional narratives. STEAM must be a new force that actually moves away from it’s deeply entrenched histories in relationship to STEM. We must use our art and design skills to challenge  old narratives and  build a new future by fighting for marginalized groups and making their histories visible through allyship.</p>

				<p>Our world is still intellectually and physically colonized. Violence towards Indigenous, Black, Latinx, Muslim, Asian, refugees, immigrants, LGBTQ+, and people with disabilities globally is common yet invisible to many in our current socio-political climate. Science and art contribute to this violence and to the gentrification of communities such communities.</p>

				<p>The word “Decolonization” often gets thrown around when talking about educational institutions and movements. However, many people ignore the original goals of “decolonization” as not just a metaphor, but a call to action to recognize the existence of the histories and cycles of violence towards Indigenous and Black bodies globally. We need to use restorative justice to validate the descendants of this violence. We need to include perspectives of Indigenous cosmology, languages, histories, and pedagogies that have historically been undermined and labeled as “uncivilized” and “primitive” by Western science. We need to validate non-European contributions to science and the arts. We need to recognize the worthiness of non-European sciences, technologies, arts, engineering, and mathematics within the scope of the academic community. This can encourage a new generation of marginalized students to be in a multidisciplinary creative and academic career.</p>

				<p>Traditional academic research and knowledge practices originate from violent settler histories towards Indigenous and Black communities. Unlearning traditional European narratives allows us to critically deconstruct our educational and social institutions. It is a complex way to challenge our western pedagogies, and to transform our futures. We need to be open to Indigenous critiques that opens complex and difficult conversations. We need more meaningful alliances and solidarity within our communities.</p>

				<p>As STEAM members, We must personally address the violent histories of our educational institutions. For me, that means acknowledging that Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design both exist because of economic wealth gained from a violent history of exploitation of Black and Brown bodies in the African slave trade, and stolen Indigenous land. Especially in conversations regarding gentrification through the development of the sciences and the arts.</p>

				<p>Science-washing and Art-washing have encouraged the displacement of communities of color is disguised as “public good” and “development” in order to improve social welfare and economics for these communities. Meanwhile, the actual problems faced by the local population get ignored, such as raised rent and higher costs of living. These communities are perpetually targeted as being “underdeveloped,” but in order to benefit the elite. It’s results from the heightened development of the future is rooted in false utopian futures. Science-washing and Art-washing are current forms of gentrification that utilize the ideals of science and art to argue for reconstruction of a community. But this remains an invisible issue disguised as progress.</p>

				<p>There is a need to be accountable of the invisibility incurred by Indigenous, Black, Asian, and Latinx communities within our American settler history of violence. This includes resettlement and enslavement from colonial settlers and the exploitation of Black and Indigenous bodies. We must actively decolonize our local, national, and global communities. We cannot allow the word decolonize to just become a passive metaphor. We need to transform and create newly inclusive spaces that have been previously and currently dominated by colonial thought.  By unlearning our mainstream western narratives of success and achievement.</p>

				<p>STEAM’s mission is to provide more efficient solutions to complex problems within the education system. To survive as a movement, we must reconstruct this mission to address the histories of our Universities in relationship to our larger communities.</p>

				<p>We can make it possible by collaborating with students and leaders of the community and beyond.  We can lead discussions and projects towards decolonial thinking and capable of visual storytelling of our community.</p>

				<p>I recognize STEAM isn’t perfect, it’s a process.  Taking account of histories of violence and oppression isn’t simple.  It is a complex process of unlearning and confronting the past colonial settler history of STEM rooted in traditional thinking. Sometimes, I feel  that the strict academic standpoint of STEAM misses many  opportunities  to transform. To decolonize is to expand one’s mind about the non-European disciplines around us and listen to non-European narratives while it also requires effort for restorative justice.</p>

				<p>We need STEAM to become a platform to lead and start these conversations and make efforts to reach out to the communities surrounding our Universities.</p>
				<p>We need STEAM to become a platform to enable leaders of different identities to lead to unlearn harmful thinking practices and create meaningful alliances.</p>
				<p>We need STEAM to become a platform to take accountability of the privilege of its STEM direction and how we to grow as a movement of radical thinking and discourse.</p>
				<p>We need STEAM to make effort towards restorative justice.</p>
