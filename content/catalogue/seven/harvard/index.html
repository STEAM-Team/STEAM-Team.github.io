				<h2>STEAM Learning Projects</h2>
				<h3>Harvard STEAM</h3>

				<h4>by Allida Lily</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					One of the central underlying themes of the learning sciences is that students retain knowledge at a deeper level  when they engage in activities that are similar to the everyday activities of professionals who work in the field. Therefore, we conducted several field trips to local facilities and organizations to learn about the implementation of STEAM education firsthand. At the beginning of the year, we visited the MIT Media Lab with members of RISD STEAM, and got to witness a variety of projects going on there, specifically the Lifelong kindergarten Group projects. The Lifelong kindergarten Group is a Media Lab research group that explores  new technologies and activities that, in the spirit of the blocks and finger paint of kindergarten, engages people in creative learning experiences. One of the projects we saw was ‘ Scratch’, a programming language and online community that makes it easy to creates stories, games and animations and learn more about code in an accessible manner. We also hosted a workshop in collaboration with Orimagi and gained hands-on experience with paper robotics. Later on in the year, we visited Nuvu Studio—an innovative learning studio in Cambridge—and assisted with one of their classes. Last but not least, we hosted a screening of Most Likely to Succeed on campus—an event that attracted both Harvard students and educators from across the Boston area.

				<h2>China Education Symposium 2018</h2>
				<h3>Harvard STEAM</h3>


				<h4>By Allida Lily</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					Our biggest event was a contribution to the China Education Symposium (CES), an annual conference held by the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Sarah Sun, one of the Harvard STEAM Co-Presidents, was on the organizing committee for the conference;she coordinated four makerspace events and a talk that included the founder of High Tech High School, the same one featured in Most Likely to Succeed. This was a hugely important contribution, because it bolstered international awareness of STEAM. Through the platform of the CES, we were able to propose the utility of STEAM in the reconstruction and reimagination of learning and education in a Chinese context, one that is rapidly evolving.

					Inspired by the Rube Goldberg-style music videos of OK Go!, our other Co-President, Allida Warn, shared a low-tech STEAM makerspace at the CES.  In this presentation, she refuted the misconception that STEAM is 100% high-tech and esoterically digital..   During the presentation, Allida created an automat with a cam-apparatus using everyday objects, including cardboard boxes, small gears, chopsticks, and art supplies; she then ran a noise-making marble out of cardboard tubes and other recycling materials. By using materials that could be found in recycling binsyour recycling been, she was able to show that the vision of imaginative engineering education does not require high-tech equipment, or massive budgets to carry out. Overall, the presentation featured the idea of systems thinking as a central learning goal to STEAM and makereducation.
