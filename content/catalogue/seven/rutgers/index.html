				<h2>Take Off With Rutgers STEAM</h2>
				<h3>DIY Kites</h3>

				<div class="image">
					<img src="kites.png" />
				</div>

				<h4>by Jenny Chen, President of Rutgers STEAM 2017-2018 school year</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					The first official event for Rutgers STEAM took place on September 8th, 2017 on the field of Busch Campus with the theme of “Taking Off with STEAM.” Rutgers STEAM demonstrated the tutorial for DIY kite making and led members to make their own DIY kites using recycled materials such as plastic trash bags and fly them on the field. When learning about kites, Rutgers STEAM also dived into the long history of kites with the first being invented as early as 5th century BC in China and its long progression and importance in human civilization. In the ancient times, they were used as a form of a messenger in wartime or wind measuring or testing tool. In modern history, kites inspired Benjamin Franklin in discovering electricity and the Wright Brothers to invent airplanes. In addition, in the process of making kites, the members learned of the importance of aerodynamics and what makes the structure of a kite functional. The most exciting part was when the members each finished making their kites and were able to see their creations soar in the sky, and enjoy moments of pure childhood joy as they chased the kites around.
				</p>

				<p>
					The event kicked off the start of the new school year of Rutgers STEAM and succeeded in securing more email subscriptions and Facebook followers, which are the two major methods of communication that Rutgers STEAM utilizes with its members.

				<h2>Artificial Intelligence Part I</h2>
				<h3>Ex Machina and Discussion</h3>

				<div class="image">

				</div>

				<h4>By Jenny Chen</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					Approaching the subject of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a different angle this time, Rutgers STEAM held a viewing session of the movie “Ex Machina” with its members and led a discussion based on the movie that extended to the greater topic of artificial intelligence on September 22nd, 2017. As the first half of the AI series, the event started off with a brief crash course on what AI was and introduced members to its wide and versatile applications, followed by the viewing of the futuristic and thought-provoking film “Ex Machina” by sci-fi writer and director Alex Garland. Film has always been a powerful medium in which art, imagination, science, and technology integrate beautifully and this particular story embodied all these elements and showcased a very interesting perspective on the potential and power of AI to the extreme. Unlike the events hosted by Rutgers STEAM in the past which all consisted of an element of educational activity, this event was more passive with the focus on discussion.
				</p>

				<p>
					Although the film itself had a fictitious nature, members were still very impressed by it and actively engaged in the discussion thereafter. They discussed the symbolism in the film, the current state of AI, potential risks of AI, the future possibilities and limitations of AI, etc. Some of them also brought up the Turing Test, which played a major role in the plot development of the film. They also shared thoughts on the film itself and how it illustrated some of these topics, which left a deep impression in some, ranging from “utterly frightened” to “ thoroughly enlightened.”

				</div>

				<h4>By Jenny Chen</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					The second part of the AI series took place on September 29th, 2017 and this time Rutgers STEAM led a casual but interactive learning experience in which students learned about the basics of AI, the history of AI, the technological side of AI, and most importantly made their own online chatbot. Building upon the first part of the series, most students now had a better idea of what AI was and what it could do. Rutgers STEAM wanted the students to have the first-hand experience of a simplified AI which would help them understand better the inner workings of AI, and thus they led a tutorial on a simple online chatbot. Students were able to input their desired questions and answers and put their own chatbot to test. In the process, they learned that many AI-based assistants work in similar but more extensive ways, and that the more higher level AI could even learn on their own.
				</p>

				<h2>Art x Mental Health</h2>
				<h3>Interactive Art Therapy</h3>

				<div class="image">

				</div>

				<h4>By Jenny Chen</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					On November 10th, 2017, Rutger STEAM held an interactive Art Therapy session and led a discussion on the importance of art. Students joined to discover the many intricate benefits of art on the brain and mental health. Led by featured speaker and a professional art therapist, Meurcie Redding, who has backgrounds in academic research as well as clinical practice, she discussed how art stimulates the neurons and builds neural pathways, boosts our mood by releasing neurotransmitters, and overall promotes brain and mental health. Best of all, Meurcie led a fun, interactive art therapy session that helped tap into one’s inner psyche, and reveal their true feelings and thoughts, all with professional help and interpretation from Meurcie. Some of the interpretative art sessions involved the topics such as “draw a person in the rain.” Many students were amazed by the activity and expressed that it was enlightening and intriguing to participate in the art.
				</p>

				<p>
					Meurcie also spoke of her experience of using art to help facilitate learning or emotional regulation for some patients that she had worked with in the past. She recounted how she was able to notice the difference in one child’s strokes in drawing and use it to predict the child’s impending anxiety attack. From there, she shifted her therapeutical focus to help ease the child’s anxiety.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the Q&A session, many students also asked the questions of interactive or art-based therapy such as the outcome and possibility of integrating them into the traditional therapy. Meurcie explained that there were also creative therapies such as drama therapy, dance therapy etc., and that she was optimistic that the public would get to know them better as time goes on.

				</div>

				<h4>By Jenny Chen</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					With the news of American Economist Richard Thayler winning the Nobel Prize in Economics, Rutgers STEAM organized a lively discussion event featuring guest speaker Professor Sjostrom from the Economics Department on November 30th, 2017. Professor Sjostrom and the students discussed the topic of Behavioral Economics, addressing and exploring questions such as “what is behavioral economics? What are some applications that utilize behavioral economics? Why do we make certain decisions and choices vs. the alternatives? How can we utilize behavioral economics to facilitate success?” as well as the recent Nobel Prize winner Richard Thayler’s “Nudge Theory.”
				</p>

				<p>
					As a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and a member of the economics Nobel prize committee, Professor Sjostrom also told the students of the process of Nobel Prize selection and the ceremony, which involved a stately dinner and meeting the royalty of Sweden, both of which he had first-hand experience.

				</div>

				<h4>By Jenny Chen</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					On January 20th, 2018, Rutgers STEAM had the pleasure of meeting up with our lovely fellow STEAM chapters at RISD STEAM, Brown STEAM, and STEAM at UGA in New York City, which was a dream come true. Together the chapters explored the depths and wonders of the ocean through National Geographic Encounter, visited the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian National Design Museum, and had many meaningful and wonderful conversations. Rutgers STEAM was also lucky enough to experience and learn about the hyper-reality show at Madame Tussauds New York and the technology used as well.
				</p>

				<p>
					Rutgers STEAM would like to thank all of the participating chapters and individuals for taking the time out and coming such a long way to this meetup! Their dedication and effort were deeply appreciated. From speaking with other chapters, Rutgers STEAM also learned of their respective models as an organization and the amazing exhibits and projects that they organized. As a team, Rutgers STEAM was very inspired and took a lot of learning from this experience. Jenny Chen (Rutgers ‘18), had the reflection that: “Moving forward, I would love to see Rutgers STEAM grow from the existing model of lecture-based DIY meetings to building concrete and sustainable projects and programs in which future and current STEAMers could continually expand and work upon, like our fellow STEAM chapters.”

				<h2>Rutgers STEAM x Psychology of Color</h2>
				<h3>February 2, 2018</h3>

				</div>

				<h4>By Michael Connelly, Secretary of Rutgers STEAM 2018 - 2019</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					Rutgers STEAM delved into the expansive realm of colors and its subliminal impacts upon human behavior and emotion. From the world of marketing to the silver screen, attendees learned about the association of colors to underlying themes or qualities. The logos of financial institutions, for instance, would tend to use blues as it is a color that promotes trust and stability; not surprisingly, green was the choice of color used by eco-friendly companies, evoking a natural and fresh undertone. Transcending and touching upon the use of colors in brand logos, we continued to discuss the implications of colors used in movies. From the bizarre and vibrant films of director Wes Anderson to the symbolism of movies such as “The Shape of Water” and “The Wizard of Oz,” colors are used to reinforce the underlying notions that are conveyed, expressed rather than stated. Not only are we now smarter shoppers, but refined film critics.

				<p class="drop_cap">
					Rutgers STEAM was thrilled to co-sponsor the Dr. Jewel Plummer Cobb S.T.E.A.M. Women’s Empowerment Conference 2018 on March 24th, 2018. Sponsored by the Division of Student Affairs and organized by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Residence Life, and Marketing & Communications, the Conference serves as an impactful and motivational forum where individuals will be inspired to take personal responsibility in owning and embracing their story and identity.
				</p>

				<p>
					This year’s theme for the conference was “Breaking through Glass Ceilings – Excellence in Leadership, Entrepreneurship and Innovation,”, a powerful phrase that encapsulates the need for women to educate one another about the importance of owning, leading and competing into today’s global market no matter what field of study or career goals.
				</p>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					The goals of the conference were to unite, educate and inspire women to 1) discover their passion and purpose and elevate their understanding of what it means to be a woman in today’s society, 2) to create an atmosphere where women from all walks of life can empower each other to achieve new levels of success, and 3) to create a platform to recognize and celebrate self-identified female students, faculty, staff and alumni who have made significant strides in their disciplines, who overcame challenges and who have left their imprint on our community today.
				</p>

				<p>
					At the conference, many accomplished female professionals as well as Rutgers students shared their story and experience and all of the attendees felt inspired by each other and expressed the need of forming a supportive community for women such as this.

				</div>

				<h4>By Jenny Chen</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					On March 28th, 2018, the Zimmerli Art Museum in New Brunswick, NJ became a hub for art and science exchange when it hosted its first official LASER, or Leonardo Art Science Evening Rendezvous. LASER is a program of Leonardo/ISAST, an international program of evening gatherings that brings artists and scientists together for informal presentations and conversations. The New Brunswick LASER committee consists of Elizabeth Demaray (Associate Professor of Fine Arts Rutgers Camden, advisor Art and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Rutgers New Brunswick), Julia Buntaine (Innovator- in- Residence, Rutgers New Brunswick), Jenny Chen (President of the Rutgers STEAM student club, Rutgers New Brunswick), and Remi Leibovic (student, Rutgers Camden).
				</p>

				<p>
					These international meetups are a platform for cross‐disciplinary dialogue and collaboration across the arts, sciences, and technology. Rutgers’ LASER aims to illuminate the extraordinary research and applied practice taking place across New Jersey in our laboratories, art studios, and classrooms. This inaugural LASER brought together students, researchers, and the greater campus community to consider the theme of “Designing with Nature.” The evening consisted of a series of lightening talks featuring the speakers John Dighton, Director of the RU Pinelands Research Center Rutgers Camden; Max Häggblom,Chair of the RU Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology Rutgers New Brunswick; and Amy Savage, Assistant Professor, Department of Biology Rutgers Camden, detailing work taking place in labs across the Rutgers’ campuses, and ended with a Q&A conversation about the intersection of art, science, technology, and design.

				<h2>RU STEAM x Eco Art</h2>
				<h3>Applied Practice in the Anthropocene</h3>

				<div class="image">

				</div>

				<h4>By Jenny Chen</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					On March 23rd, 2018,  the artist Elizabeth Demaray presented a lecture on Art/Sci Collaboration and Applied Practice in the Anthropocene. Working in collaboration with scientists, engineers, and the general public, Demaray’s artwork explored the intersections of environmental science and visual arts, provoked questions about humans’ complex relationships with the natural world, and opened avenues of research in unexpected directions. Students learned about the creative ways in which one could integrate art and nature, explore the complex relationships of humanity and the natural world, and make “noninformative flyers” from recycled magazines.
				</p>

				<p>
					While talking about her art, Demaray stated “my focus is on the interface between the built and the natural environment. My work often involves the concept of a biotope, which is a small environment where human and non-human populations overlap. It may also concern the concept of trans-species giving. This idea asserts that the commonalities between life forms are such that we may be able to give other organisms a hand-up.” In this vein, Demaray designs listening stations for birds that play human music, cultures lichen on the sides of skyscrapers in New York City, and manufactures alternative forms of housing for hermit crabs. Collaborating with teams in engineering, biology, and computer science, she recently created an interactive art installation called the Inda Plant Project: An Act of Trans-Species Giving. This artwork entails building machine-intelligent robotic supports for houseplants. These moving “floraborgs” allow potted-plants to roam freely in a domestic environment, in search of sunlight and water.
				</p>

				<p>
					In her presentation for Rutgers STEAM, Demaray detailed several artworks that she has authored in which science is an integral component. She discussed the ways that art and science collaboration can create opportunities to raise awareness of ecological issues, highlight the work of individual scientists and initiate innovation in unexpected directions. She also talked about the challenges and rewards inherent in working across institutional boundaries to address applied practice in the Anthropocene.

				<h2>Careers in S.T.E.A.M Panel</h2>
				<h3>An Exploration in the Multidisciplinary Careers and How to Turn Everything You Love into a Profession</h3>

				<div class="image">
					<img src="careers-in-steam.png" />
				</div>

				<h4>By Jenny Chen</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					The inaugural Rutgers STEAM career panel took place on April 13th, 2018 and aimed to introduce the student body to the applications of STEAM in the real world and the potential of many interdisciplinary careers that one could pursue versus the more traditional options that are often considered the standard among college students. The goal was to show the students how to hustle in the new age of interdisciplinary fields and fuse all of their diverse passions into a career path.
				</p>

				<p>
					In addition, the event also featured Eco Art exhibitions that were 100% handmade by the Rutgers STEAM E-Board from waste and recycled materials as part of the “Earth Day/Earth Month” awareness campaign.
				</p>

				<p>
					As the biggest event of the Rutgers STEAM for the school year, the career panel took months of preparation that started during winter break. With the goal of making this event unlike anything that had been previously hosted by a student organization at Rutgers, the E-Board developed into respective teams and set out clear goals for logistics, attendance goal (100 students per the maximum room capacity), speakers, promotions, etc. President Jenny Chen (Rutgers ‘18) oversaw the overall operation and took the lead in contacting potential panelists who would be interested in joining the students for a discussion and speaking about their own experience and designing the logistics. The Technology Head, Marcy Alvarez, (Rutgers ‘18) was in charge of the promotional swags and the Eco-Art exhibit. Science Head Riya Prabhudesai (Rutgers ‘20) was in charge of the speaker team as well, and treasurer Benjamin Cahnbley (Rutgers ‘18) was responsible for budget and assisted in all activities along with other E-Board members. Many of them put in countless hours, determined to make the panel a success.
				</p>

				<p>
					At the event, Rutgers STEAM was thrilled to have amazing panelists that were designers, engineers, data scientists, artists, neuroscientists, researchers, etc. from Facebook, SciArt Center, Adobe, Scientific American and NYU in various multidisciplinary fields, including tech, design, science, etc. and ranging from academia to industry. They were Julia Buntaine (SciArt Center Director, SciArt Magazine Editor-in-Chief), Alexandra Cohen (Postdoctoral Fellow, Developmental Neuroscientist at NYU), Amanda Montanez (Graphics Editor at Scientific American), Ingrid Parades (Engineering Ph.D Candidate at NYU), Danica Sapit (Full Stack Engineer at Adobe), and Rannie Teodoro (Research Manager at Facebook).
				</p>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					The panelists discussed their respective career paths and how they discovered their passion and got to where they are today, which to many were nonlinear as they completed their bachelors, masters, and even Ph.Ds in school and not sure where to go next. Julia Buntaine, recounting her studies in both neuroscience and art in school, was often discouraged whenever she brought up the idea of integrating art and science. Nonetheless, the dismissal inspired her to go forth and found the SciArt center, which has now grown to be an influential organization in STEAM and regularly hosts exhibits on interdisciplinary topics. Other panelists also shared the experience of carving a new career path for themselves, such as Rannie Teodoro, who has a Ph.D in communications. She recalled how her Ph.D trained her thought process which was the most beneficial to her as a degree and how she was able to utilize such skills in her role as a user experience research manager and understanding how people think. Many panelists who have a Ph.D degree or in the process of obtaining one also echoed the sentiment.
				</p>

				<p>
					While many took the route of establishing their own roles or careers, some panelists also followed the traditional route. Alexandra Cohen whose research had been featured in the New York Times continued her work after her Ph.D completion, which was her passion and she enjoyed the diversity that her work encompassed. Ingrid Parades, who is an engineering Ph.D candidate at NYU also agreed that although she had thought of other options besides the family expectation of becoming an engineer, she discovered the subfields within engineering that she fell in love with and now she got to work on sustainable development and science outreach such as hosting the March for Science in NYC.
				</p>

				<p>
					The panelists remarked on the possibilities that one could create during one’s career,that there are many ways leading to success and that students not to limit themselves. They also gave professional advice to students, from how to deal with conflicts at work to how to best present oneself. Danica Sapit, who is now a full-stack engineer at Adobe, recounted her first job at a large financial institution and realizing that was not a good fit for her, which happens to many new grads entering the real world. She took the action of searching for a better fit while working hard at her former position and found the job she now has at Adobe that allows her to combine her creativity and artistry with her expertise which she loves. The decision certainly took courage, especially for a newly grad who was still trying to find their foothold and independence in the real world, but it was necessary, and Danica encouraged students to be open-minded and explore what works best for them and take the leap.
				</p>

				<p>
					After the main panel event, a more intimate mentoring session took place where the panelists could converse directly with the students and answer any questions they might have. Students really enjoyed this panel and appreciated the chance to speak with the panelists directly.

				<h2>Reflections on STEAM</h2>
				<h3>What does it mean to do STEAM in 2018?</h3>

				<h4>By Michael Connelly</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					Going forward in STEAM calls for what I regard as a rather imperative and well-deserved attention to political discourse. It is essential to have the desire to continue to expand and challenge one’s views and perceptions and to continue to discover. Being a member of STEAM means to persevere and to explore the links and the integration of the sciences and the arts across a great and broad spectrum; being a devoted member of STEAM denotes a certain individual, one able to create and interpret and explore, one who is motivated by the will to continue learning. The product of STEAM is not intended to be a well-refined and diversified scientist or artist, but a well-refined individual; rather than limiting ourselves to be confined to simply STEAM, I think we must instead continue to expand and diversify our own discourse.
