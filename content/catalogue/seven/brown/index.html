				<h3>reflections on why we do STEAM</h3>

				<h4>by Ethan Mok, President of Brown STEAM 2017-2018</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					The old line is that if you can’t explain something to your grandma, or to a five-year-old, then you don’t really understand it. That once you really know something, you can boil it down to its core features and describe it as easily as retelling a story. That understanding comes first, and that words come second.
				</p>
              
                <p>
					I think it’s only half true.
				</p>
              
                <p>
					Words are powerful. Stories are powerful. Sure, they come from understanding, but they’re also how we understand things in the first place: by “putting things in our own words,” by turning some book’s abstract nonsense or a teacher’s dry lecture into something that that we can relate to and see in our normal lives. They are how we discover and rediscover passion. 
				</p>
              
                <p class="drop_cap">
					When I first joined STEAM, I loved it. And what wasn’t to love? STEAM was STEM + Art, plain and simple. I did strange science things, I did strange art things, sign me up. And the more I got into it, the more wonderful STEAM became. STEAM was biomimicry and design and human computer interaction. It was about making cool things with cool people and it was everything to me --- until it wasn’t. Until I stopped having the time to do cool projects. Until I just spent more and more time in the lab. Until I stopped writing. 
				</p>
              
                <p>
					It’s hard to believe in something you don’t do anymore.
				</p>
              
                <p>
					Last year, I went into our end-of-year post mortem with the words “I’m done” rattling around in my skull. After all, I was the president, and some president I would be if I couldn’t practice what I preached. At Brown, our post-mortems usually entail what we did that year and any issues we had with logistics or events. We talk about what we want to do next year and start planning our overall goals. This year, since we did a lot of reorganization around what we wanted STEAM to be, we asked everyone to define what STEAM meant to them. The first time the question came around to me I just said what I’ve said before: “STEAM is about making cool interdisciplinary projects." It was the first one that came to mind. It was the one I’d been taught, the one we told everyone else. It was the only one we had. And I hated it. I hated how trite it was. I hated it because it kept me from something I knew I loved. I hated it because if STEAM were just making, then STEAM shouldn’t have been a part of my life (but it was), shouldn’t have been something that I thought about every day (but it was), shouldn’t have been something I felt in my bones as something that made me me <span class="italic">(but it WAS).</span>
				</p>
              
                <p> So I thought about it. </p>
              
                <p> And thought, and thought … </p>
              
                <p> What was STEAM to me? </p>

                <p> To me STEAM is learning that dancing has its own notation system that some people use to teach robots how to move. It is listening to people talk about how much gesture-based UIs can learn from ASL. It is watching the way sharks and jellyfish move, and thinking about how different characters move through the air in Melee. It is realizing despite how vast the universe is, that you can never truly get lost — that you’ll always have something to hang your hat on. </p> 
              
                <p class="italic"> It is seeing things I knew in things I didn’t - putting the world in my own words. </p>
              
                <p class="drop_cap"> After those realizations, I came out of our post-mortem more excited for another round of STEAM than I had been since freshman year. Because STEAM isn’t just about making, isn’t something I have to take time out of my day to do, it’s a way of thinking, a way of seeing the world. It’s something that anyone can do by just looking around or talking to a friend. STEAM is a way of learning that embraces how interconnected everything is, and how much more interesting that makes the world we live in. </p>
              
                <p> I think I finally understand STEAM — Grandma, do you? </p>

				<h2>Subtle Bodies</h2>
				<h3>Transcending the Physical Plane Through Virtual Reality</h3>

				<h4>By Mariel Rosic, Brown STEAM Project Lead</h4>

				<p class="drop_cap">
					When I awoke, I was met with an infinite expanse of emptiness. I could not feel my body, and, for a few seemingly fleeting moments, even forgot I inhabited one.
				</p>

				<p>				
                    I was naked, suspended in 30cm of densely salinated and unnervingly viscous water contained within an egg-shaped clamshell bath. My foetal capsule was without light, and I was swathed in total silence
				</p>
              
                <p>				
                    For the past hour, I had been lying, mostly asleep, in a sensory deprivation tank in a tiny home tucked away in the middle of Beijing. It was the summer of 2017. One week prior to this float, I happened to experience virtual reality for the first time: deeply meditative, trance-like, and psychedelic audio-visual experiences.
				</p>
              
                <p>				
                    The rest of my summer followed a similarly serendipitous and uncanny pattern of stumbling upon novel, perspective-shifting experiences… and so began my unexpected free-dive into questions of embodiment, sensory perception, consciousness, reality and emptiness.
				</p>
              
                <p class="drop_cap">				
                    Fast-forward six months, and I am sitting in a meeting with my STEAM friends, discussing ideas for new projects: any ideas that married computer science and the arts were fair game. I happened to mention my VR and float experiences over the summer, and how exciting it would be to mimic those experiences and share them with friends. That conversation spurred the creation of a STEAM project titled “Subtle Bodies”, a name suggestive of the ephemerality and emptiness of our physical selves.
				</p>
              
                <p>				       
                    I wanted to use VR, a powerful and exciting technology, to give others a taste of the transformative experiences I had last summer.
				</p>
              
                <p>				       
                    The goal of this project is to create two experiences that present users with a radical shift in perspective, leaving them questioning embodiment, consciousness and their senses. How does my sensory perception shape my views, emotions, and the world I inhabit? How does removing my visual field from my body affect how I see myself, my place in the world, and others? How is my experience of this reality limited, or enhanced, by my senses?
				</p>
              
                 <p>				       
                    We want people to, very simply, see themselves and their bodies in new ways.
				</p>
              
                <p>				       
                    In our first experience, we use screens paired to another person’s camera to switch users’ perspectives, mimicking out-of-body experiences and quite literally letting users “walk in each other’s shoes”. <a href="https://vimeo.com/76215588"> (Watch this video to see our inspiration for this experience). </a>
				</p>
              
                <p>				       
                    Our second experience, still in its ideation phase, will ideally be a fully immersive, visually abstract, generative, multi-sensory VR experience. We are playing with ideas of audio-visual coupling, but also exploring tactile sensation and debating the use of hundreds of tiny vibration motors that envelop the user and control minute fluctuations across the body in tandem with the user’s heartbeat, or perhaps their breath.
				</p>
              
                <p>				       
                    We aim to “exhibit” both experiences as installations in a multimedia gallery in the fall, intentionally and carefully carving out slices of space and time in which to share this with others.
				</p>
                <p class="drop-cap">				       
                    We have just begun this project and will begin generating prototypes in the coming days and weeks. We are so passionate and excited about this opportunity to facilitate transformative experiences for our peers. Stay tuned for updates on our progress.

	          	<h4>by Brad Guesman, Brown STEAM Project Lead</h4>

	          	<p class="drop_cap">David Schurman (my friend here at Brown and fellow STEAM leader) and I were both frustrated with the lack of visual music discovery tools out there. After searching for a virtual ‘music map’ of sorts, we were disappointed with the results. Most maps either only went one relational level deep or — even worse — were text based!</p>

				<p>We realized that, in order for a related artists graph to be meaningful, two layers of depth are necessary, and relations between artists that are not the center artist have to be represented. This quite literally ties artists who are similar to each other together in the visualization.</p>

				<p>This is particularly useful for seeing what different genres artists draw from. For instance, if you search “BØRNS” on Musicfind, you’ll see two groups form. One has artists from the new wave (well, one definition of new wave) scene, like Hippo Campus, Bleachers and WALK THE MOON. Another is populated with female-dominant indie pop groups, like Banks, Broods, and Wet. These visually distinct areas of the graph represent two different facets of BØRNS’ musical style.</p>

				<p class="drop_cap">As much as we’d love for this to be a fully functioning music discovery tool, it is still just an experiment. Cross-platform support is a goal for the future — it currently only works on Chrome due to some optimization requirements involving moving around and styling images in SVG. It would also be wonderful to give users full access to their Spotify accounts from the webpage so they can manage playlists while searching around the map. While we have abandoned work on Musicfind for now, we hope that sometime before the end of the year we can come back to it and turn it into the beautiful visual artist discovery tool that music enthusiasts deserve.</p>
