  		<h1>Brown STEAM</h1>
		<p>
			Brown STEAM is a student group at Brown University. The mentality of STEAM hinges upon the ability to draw astute connections between disciplines and fearlessly explore potential for collaboration at the interface. We strive to integrate the creativity and aesthetics of the arts; the problem solving tools and rigor of the STEM fields; and the critical thinking and ethical considerations of the humanities. We believe that this unification powerfully drives progress toward the future.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a student group we hold regular meetings, usually made up of STEAM-related discussions, speakers, or events. We also host on-campus workshops, do outreach within Brown and the local community, and take occasional field trips. We seek to provide a platform, resource base, and discussion group for interdisciplinary thinking and projects.
		</p>
		<p class="last">
			We are close partners with <a href="RISDSTEAM.html">RISD STEAM</a>, our neighbors in Providence, RI.
