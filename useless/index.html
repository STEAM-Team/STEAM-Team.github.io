				<p><strong>Useless Hackathon</strong></p>
				<p>Saturday, December 2nd, 10am - 7pm, Brown Design Workshop </p>
				<p>Inspired by ITP's <a href="http://www.stupidhackathon.com/">Stupid Hackathon</a>, Brown/RISD STEAM is hosting the Useless Hackathon--a place to make useless, weird, silly, random stuff (emphasis on weird). It'll be a really fun and laid-back day-long event away from the pressure of "practicality" and allowing for the potential for lots of creativity! Finished projects can be displayed in an open exhibition for the end of the day to celebrate the fact that you just made a thing!*
				</p>
				<p><strong>C R A P: An Exposition of Useless Garbáge</strong></p>
				<p>Saturday, December 2nd, 7:30pm - 9pm, Brown Design Workshop</p>
				<p>Following the hackathon, Brown/RISD STEAM proudly presents C R A P: An Exposition of Worthless Garbáge. Resulting from countless hours, or maybe minutes, of work at the Useless Hackathon, these pieces are the culmination of the imagination and creativity of the event’s participants. Please join us in this celebration of inventive, useless design, as one person's trash is another's garbáge.</p>
				<p>This exhibition is open to the public.</p>

						<h3>Project #1</h3>
						<p>VY Canis Majoris is the largest star known to man. It is a red Hypergiant, located in the Milky way and measuring between 1800 to 2100 solar radii. One Radius is equal to the current radius of the Sun and it is approximately 432,450 miles (695,500 kilometers). VY Canis Majoris is so large that if our Sun were replaced by it, its surface would extend to (or maybe even pass) the <em>orbit of Saturn</em></p>
