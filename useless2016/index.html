				<p><strong>Useless Hackathon</strong></p>
				<p>Saturday, December 2nd, 10am - 7pm, Brown Design Workshop </p>
				<p>Inspired by ITP's <a href="http://www.stupidhackathon.com/">Stupid Hackathon</a>, Brown/RISD STEAM is hosting the Useless Hackathon--a place to make useless, weird, silly, random stuff (emphasis on weird). It'll be a really fun and laid-back day-long event away from the pressure of "practicality" and allowing for the potential for lots of creativity! Finished projects can be displayed in an open exhibition for the end of the day to celebrate the fact that you just made a thing!*
				</p>
				<p><strong>C R A P: An Exposition of Useless Garbáge</strong></p>
				<p>Saturday, December 2nd, 7:30pm - 9pm, Brown Design Workshop</p>
				<p>Following the hackathon, Brown/RISD STEAM proudly presents C R A P: An Exposition of Worthless Garbáge. Resulting from countless hours, or maybe minutes, of work at the Useless Hackathon, these pieces are the culmination of the imagination and creativity of the event’s participants. Please join us in this celebration of inventive, useless design, as one person's trash is another's garbáge.</p>
				<p>This exhibition is open to the public.</p>

						<h3>USELESS WORD PROCESSOR</h3>
						<h4>David Schurman</h4>
						<p>Word processors, like Microsoft Word, have become an important and universal part of our society. I wanted to take the highly effective and user-friendly concept of a word processor and make it highly ineffective and frustrating. As you type into the Useless Word Processor, it will randomly change some of your keystrokes to backspaces, making what you write almost completely unintelligible. Enjoy!</p>

						<h3>PILLOW TALK</h3>
						<h4>Anya Parakh + Raina Wellman + Tiffany Chiu + Khue Truong</h4>
						<p style>It’s been a long day, you’re exhausted and want nothing more than to sink into the softness of your pillow. Except, just as your brain’s starting to give away and you’re on the verge of sleep you hear something…           ”Pssssst, you awake?”<br><br>
						You look around, who is it? You wonder.<br><br>
						“Hey, yeah you, I was wondering, like, why is peanut butter and jelly a thing? Like who the “beep” came up with it?” It’s your PILLOW!<br><br>
						Pillow Talk is a revolutionary object that changes the way you sleep...in the sense that you don’t. Are you the kind of person who needs incredibly thought provoking questions to get your mind reeling just as you pass out, thus keeping you awake? Do you consistently like to be reminded of how bad your hair smells or how you really do NOT need this nap with all that homework you have? Or are you just someone who hates sex but loves pillow talk? Well, Pillow Talk is just what you need!</p>

						<h3>INVERTED KITCHEN UTENSILS</h3>
						<h4>Katie Wu</h4>
						<p>We often take for granted the utility of various utensils used in the kitchen. For example, we expect knives to cut, forks to stab, and spoons to be able to hold some kind of liquid. This series of kitchen utensils has an essential component of their form altered so that they become unusable for their traditional purpose.</p>
