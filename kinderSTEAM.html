  		<h1>KinderSTEAM</h1>
		<p>
			KinderSTEAM is Brown/RISD STEAM club’s partnership with Jewish Community Day School of Rhode Island, a local Providence school for grades Pre-K-5. Since January 2014, JCDSRI has generously opened their doors to student teachers from Brown and RISD to lead discipline-bending lessons to supplement the K-5th grade pedagogy. JCDSRI stands out as a progressive education initiative because of their “Design Lab” curriculum, which is led by Sari Guttin in a dedicated Maker Space within the school. Past workshops have allowed JCDSRI students to have a hands-on experience with units on the moon, geometry, optical illusions, animal ecosystems, or addition. Each lesson applies methodologies and principles unique to art and design thinking, such as experimentation with material, iterative problem solving, and storytelling, to STEM-related content.
